        The primary function of a paragraph as a unit of meaning is
        organizational. If all writing is communication, then the text is the
        total meaning of this communication. It is impossible to impart this
        meaning to the reader all at once, in an unstructured whole.
        Paragraphing, then, is the means to which this total meaning can be
        divided and structured so that a reader can absorb the text sensibly. To
        use a metaphor, we cannot eat a whole chicken; a considerate cook will
        cut the chicken into manageable parts, and they will usually do so at
        the easiest points and into the most natural sections: the leg, wing,
        thighs, breast, neck, etc. These parts are the most recognizable to us,
        and we understand how they articulate with each other to form the whole
        chicken. In the same way,
